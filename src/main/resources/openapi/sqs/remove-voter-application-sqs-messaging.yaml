    EMS Application Data Removal API SQS Message Types for EROP

    Messages defined in this spec are produced by EROP and consumed by EMS.

    Any changes to this spec should be based on joint collaboration and agreement between EROP and EM.

    Whilst this is an openAPI spec, it does not imply being used to define REST APIs, nor is it intended to.

    The `paths` elements are being used to document (at a high level) the SQS queues and the request bodies that are expected
    to be published to them. **There is no intent to generate or implement SQS queues or listener classes from this document.**

    The `paths` element is only being used in order to maintain the structure of the openApi spec, as `paths` are required
    elements.
