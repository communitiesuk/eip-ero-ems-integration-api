    description: |
      Indicates whether this reason should be incuded in comms to the Elector and this field is sufficient alone - EMS implementations do not need to consider the type as well.
      EROP will automatically ensure this is false for any reason that should never be included in comms.
      EROP may provide ERO's flexibility to select which reasons they would like to be sent to the elector.
