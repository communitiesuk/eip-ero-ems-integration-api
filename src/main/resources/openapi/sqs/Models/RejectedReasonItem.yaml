      A static value that can be used by EMSs to add additional business logic if needed.
      The current values are below but may change overtime, hence this is not an enforced restricted list / enum.
      Should EROP add a new 'type' or revise one, we would not want EMSs to require a deployment.
      As such these values should not be used for business logic in processing applications, but could be used for aggregations of rejection reasons across applications.

    description: |
      Indicates whether this reason should be incuded in comms to the Elector and this field is sufficient alone - EMS implementations do not need to consider the type as well.
      EROP will automatically ensure this is false for any reason that should never be included in comms.
      EROP may provide ERO's flexibility to select which reasons they would like to be sent to the elector.
    default: true
