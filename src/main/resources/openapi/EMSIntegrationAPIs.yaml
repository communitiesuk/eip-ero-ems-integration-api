  title: EROP EMS Integration APIs for Postal and Proxy Vote Applications (OAVA)
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    This specification is for an API hosted by EROP (part of IERDS) for EMS clients to fetch
    details of Postal Vote and Proxy Vote applications made by the public.
    
    The term OAVA is used in places, meaning "Online Absent Vote Applications", to encompass
    Postal Vote and Proxy Vote.
    
    EMSs can pull OAVA applications from a queue and acknowledge each application as successfully downloaded.
    
    See also: 
      = "IER EMS API" for the EMS facing API in IER that relays Register to Vote applications
      = EROP to EMS Register Checker API

        This endpoint acts as a notification queue. To ensure resilience against communication failures, reading entries from this queue does not consume them. After successfully receiving a notification from this endpoint, the EMS should call the "DELETE /postalVotes/{id}" endpoint for each notification that it has received.

        The server will not lock or hide records between the GET and DELETE calls, so it is not safe to call this endpoint concurrently from multiple client workers or threads without adding client-side deduplication or idempotency.
