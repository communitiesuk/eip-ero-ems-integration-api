  title: EROP EMS Integration APIs for Postal and Proxy Vote Applications (OAVA)
  version: 1.3.0
  description: |
    This specification is for an API hosted by EROP for EMS clients to fetch
    details of Postal Vote and Proxy Vote applications made by the public.

    The term OAVA is used in places, meaning "Online Absent Vote Applications", to encompass
    Postal Vote and Proxy Vote.

    EMSs can pull OAVA applications from a queue and acknowledge each application as successfully downloaded.

    Authentication to this API is handled via TLS client certificates. Each client EMS system is issued
    a client certificate by IERDS which will authenticate and identify the client. See doc referenced below.

        ## Overview

        When an application for a Postal Vote is received via the IER web frontend, it is passed to EROP by IER. When an application is received on paper the ERO will transcribe it into the EROP.

        Postal Vote applications from both sources will be processed in EROP by ERO staff until the application is either accepted or rejected.

        Accepted applications will have verified the identity of the person making the application; verified that the applicant is a registered elector in the current LA/VJB (see "Register Checker API” https://github.com/communitiesuk/eip-ero-register-checker-api/blob/main/src/main/resources/openapi/RegisterCheckerAPIs.yaml); and verified that the signature is acceptable.

        If any of the above conditions can't be satisfied, applications will be rejected.

        EMS systems are responsible for sending approved and rejected communications to electors, this service will return both approved and rejected applications to EMSs.

        EMS are expected to poll this endpoint regularly and automatically update the corresponding elector records without user intervention. We recommend polling once every 5 minutes.

        ## Queue Management

        This endpoint acts as a notification queue. To ensure resilience against communication failures, reading entries from this queue does not consume them. After successfully receiving a notification from this endpoint, the EMS should call the "`PUT /postalvotes/{id}`" endpoint for each notification that it has received and successfully processed.

        The server will not lock or hide records between the GET and DELETE calls, so it is not safe to call this endpoint concurrently from multiple client workers or threads without adding client-side deduplication or idempotency.

        ## Elector ID and Identity Matching

        During processing in EROP, approved applications must be matched to known electors in the current LA/VJB. This will be assisted and confirmed using the "Register Checker API”. Any ambiguity in the matching will have been resolved and explicitly matched to a corresponding elector with the LA/VJB's EMS system. The result of this matching will be returned with each application in the “emsElectorId” field.

        Should no match exist within the EMS, applications will be rejected and will not contain the “emsElectorId” field and EMS systems will be responsible for rejected notifications to the applicants.

        The receiving EMS system must use this “emsElectorId” to match which elector record to update. The other fields (“fn”, “ln”, “dob”, “reguprn” etc.) are for information and diagnostic purposes only. An EMS system receiving this application MUST NOT automatically override the matching that has been selected by the ERO user in the case of ambiguous names or similar.

        ## Note about electors applying both to register and for a postal vote

        We expect many Electors may apply both to Register to Vote and for a Postal Vote at around the same time on the public facing website (one after the other). In that case the Absent Vote application will be held in the EROP (shown as “pending”) and will not appear in this queue until the applicant is registered.

                # Postal - Proxy Applications
                
                Where this entity is not null it indicates that the application is for 
                a "postal-proxy" application. 
                
                This contains the nominated proxy's details that will have been legally verified within EROP.

                The registeredAddress remains the registered address of the Elector, with the ballot address fields used for the Proxy.
                For approved Postal Proxy applications the elector's ballot should be sent to the nominated Proxy's address which will be 1 of the following addresses:
                * ballotAddress
                * ballotOverseasPostalAddress
                * ballotBfpoPostalAddress

                When populated, the following fields are now associated with the Proxy, and not the Elector.
                * email
                * phone
                * signature

            The current values are below but may change overtime, hence this is not an enforced restricted list / enum.
            Should EROP add a new 'type' or revise one, we would not want EMSs to require a deployment.
            As such these values should not be used for business logic in processing applications, but could be used for aggregations of rejection reasons across applications.
